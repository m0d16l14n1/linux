 * Apple SoC system sleep
 *
 * On some Apple SoCs a kernel can run directly at EL2 behind the CTXR execute
 * window (Documentation/arch/arm64/ctxr-execmem.rst), with no monitor below it.
 * So no PSCI answers a request to power a CPU off or to suspend the system, and
 * the kernel does both itself.
 *
 * iBoot locks every core's reset vector to the boot object. A core that comes
 * back from a power-off therefore restarts inside the boot object (aura), and
 * that has to send it back here. The boot object opts in by publishing a mailbox
 * in /chosen/aurora,s2r-mailbox, which also gives its spin-table CPUs the parking
 * spin table (arch/arm64/kernel/cpu_ops.c). Without it this driver does nothing:
 *
 *  - A secondary core goes back through its spin-table release address, which
 *    the boot object keeps, into secondary_holding_pen.
 *  - The boot core takes cpu_resume from the mailbox: EL2, MMU off.
 *
 * The register addresses are in the device tree. The ADT has every one of them,
 * as /arm-io/pmgr's or /arm-io/wdt's reg entries. Register offsets and order not
 * otherwise explained here were measured from a macOS sleep under aura.
 *
 * What the kernel does in suspend-to-RAM is what macOS does in its last 14 ms,
 * with the order kept. What differs between SoCs, their power words and the
 * lists macOS was measured with, is each SoC's match data. Only SoCs measured
 * and tested that way are matched: on the others this driver doesn't bind, and
 * s2idle stays the only sleep.
 *
 * T8132 takes the same path with its own tables and operations, t8132_sleep_ops,
 * measured the same way from a macOS sleep under aura's hypervisor. Its blocks are
 * T8140's at the same offsets from a SoC base 0x80000000 higher unless noted.
 *
 * A SoC whose sequences differ in more than its lists brings them as a part
 * (sleep-internal.h), and shares the registry of coprocessors with the rest:
 * today T6040, in sleep-t6040.c.

/*
 * T8142 (M5: MacBook Air J813/J815, MacBook Pro J704). No M5 sleep has been traced: this is
 * T8132's sleep with T8142's words, translated by name from the J815 ADT and checked against
 * the macOS 27.2.1 kernelcache (26B131) where the code says more:
 *  - XNU's last-WFI path is the same code for both SoCs.
 *  - AppleT8142PMGR's sleep entry and restoreHW are T8132's in order. A complex comes on as
 *    (word | 0xf), then bit 4 clears; restoreHW then sets pwrgate +0x0 and +0x60, the boot
 *    cores of E and P, read-modify-write.
 *  - Its quiescePerfState takes the SoC to 3 and DCS to 3, through 5 from 6 and up, before
 *    the complexes go off, and adds a "sleep hack" right before the S2R timer:
 *    PMGR_SOC_CLLT.EARLY_WAKEUP_CFG (+0x50) bits 17:16 cleared. Its EVENT_CFG step calls a
 *    method that is empty on T8142. The S2R timer is T8132's commit word.
 *  - The wake block has nine mask words (sources 0..267), then nine status words.
 *  - No clock mux and no memory-controller lane step: AppleT8142MCC turns the cache's ways
 *    off as its platform sleep action, which mcc.c does at suspend_noirq.
 *  - Its SPMI controllers are gen 4.
 * iBoot leaves the boot core's power-gate enable (+0x60) clear: with it clear the boot core
 * never powers off in its last WFI, the P complex stays BUSY, and WD2 resets the SoC after
 * the commit. The DT's cluster power gate sets it at boot (apple-cluster-pwrgate.c), as on
 * T8132 and T6050.
